# 2D Game Python Project

"it's gotta be like terraria..."
-**LYS**

## Objective and Overview

The purpose of this project is to come together as a friend group and create
something awesome... simply a byproduct of fun times.

There is no firm objective, other than that the game must have some sort of
gambling mechanic ;)

## Tasks and Completion Dates

Tasks | Completion Date
--- | ---
First draft & initial ideas | TBA
Spritesheet | TBA

## File Structure

* **SESO.py** -- Random Python file. Run it lol.

* **diddy.py** -- Sample file with starter code. Makes use of pygame, a free,
  open-source Python library that allows programmers to create video games, and
  is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and extensive community support.
  More than open to use an alternative package.

That's it!

## Getting Started
There's a couple of things that you might want:

* **VS Code**, or any IDE that will help you develop content.
* **Python**. You can download it from the official website.
* **pygame**. You might have to pip install this. Contact me for help.
* **A terminal**. I like using Warp, but the native macOS terminal is solid.
  This can be any really.
